**Effective Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Last Updated**: October 9, 2025

## Overview

PhotoSift ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how PhotoSift handles your information when you use our AI-powered photo organization application.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

PhotoSift is designed with privacy in mind. **We do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of your personal information or images.**

Specifically, PhotoSift does NOT:
- Collect personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- Access your photos remotely or upload them to any server
- Store your images outside of your local device
- Track your usage or behavior
- Share any data with third parties
- Require user accounts or registration
- Use cookies or similar tracking technologies
- Collect device identifiers or location data

## How PhotoSift Works

PhotoSift operates entirely on your local device:

1. **Local Processing**: All image analysis and classification happens on your computer using AI models stored locally
2. **File Access**: The app only accesses image files that you explicitly select through the folder selection dialog
3. **No Internet Required**: Once installed, PhotoSift works completely offline and does not require an internet connection
4. **Local Storage**: All processed results remain on your device

## Data You Control

### Images You Select
- You choose which folders and images to process
- PhotoSift only accesses files you explicitly select
- No images are copied, moved, or transmitted without your direct action
- You maintain complete control over your files at all times

### Application Settings
- Any preferences or settings are stored locally on your device
- No configuration data is transmitted or stored remotely

## AI Model Information

PhotoSift uses the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) model by OpenAI for image classification:
- The AI model is downloaded once during installation and stored locally
- Image processing happens entirely on your device
- No image data is sent to OpenAI or any external service
- The model operates offline after installation

## File Operations

When you use PhotoSift's organization features:
- File movements and deletions are performed locally on your device
- A local "trash" folder may be created to store items you choose to remove
- All file operations are under your direct control and can be undone manually

## Children's Privacy

PhotoSift does not collect any information from users of any age. The app is suitable for all ages as it processes only the images you choose to analyze locally on your device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of PhotoSift after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Third-Party Components

PhotoSift uses the following third-party technologies:
- **CLIP Model by OpenAI**: Used locally for image classification (no data transmission)
- **Python Libraries**: PIL, PyTorch, Transformers, Tkinter (all operate locally)

None of these components collect or transmit your personal data.

## Your Rights and Control

Since PhotoSift does not collect any personal data:
- There is no personal data to access, modify, or delete
- You have complete control over all files processed by the application
- You can uninstall the application at any time without any data remaining on external servers
