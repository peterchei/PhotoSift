# PhotoSift v1.2.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** October 12, 2025

## üéâ What's New in v1.2.0

### Enhanced User Interface
- **Dynamic Button Text**: Select All button now intelligently displays "Select All" or "Unselect All" based on current selection state
- **Comprehensive Tooltips**: Added helpful tooltips to Select All and Clean buttons in both DuplicateImageIdentifierGUI and ImageClassifierGUI
- **Improved Image Viewer**: Enhanced image information display with comprehensive EXIF metadata including:
  - Full file path with copy-to-clipboard functionality (Ctrl+C)
  - Camera make and model
  - Date taken
  - Exposure settings (f-stop, shutter speed, ISO, focal length)
  - GPS location indicator
  - File size, dimensions, format, and color mode

### Duplicate Image Identifier Improvements
- **Group-Based Paging**: Pagination now works by duplicate groups (10 groups per page) instead of individual images, ensuring all duplicate images from the same group stay together on the same page
- **Smart Selection**: Select All button intelligently keeps the first image in each group unchecked (treating it as the original)
- **Better State Management**: Select All button text now properly resets across all user actions:
  - Page navigation (Next/Previous)
  - After cleanup operations
  - Manual checkbox changes
  - Initial display

### Quality of Life Enhancements
