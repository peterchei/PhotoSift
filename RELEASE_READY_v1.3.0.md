## 📋 What's New in v1.3.0

### 🌍 Critical Bug Fix: Unicode Path Support
**Problem Fixed**: Images in folders with Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters were incorrectly marked as 100% duplicates

**Why It Happened**: OpenCV couldn't read Unicode file paths, so all images were loaded as blank, making them appear identical

**Solution**: Replaced OpenCV with PIL for image loading

**Impact**: International users can now use native language folder names!

### 🎚️ New Feature: Adjustable Similarity Threshold
- Slider control from 80% to 99%
- Quality guide (Identical/Near duplicates/Similar/Loosely related)
- Fast re-grouping (10-20x faster than re-scanning)
- Real-time percentage display

### ⚡ UX Improvements
- **Start Scan Button**: Separated folder selection from scanning
- **Auto-Select Groups**: Results automatically displayed after scan
- **Image Count**: Shows number of images after folder selection

---

## 📊 Testing Status

```
✅ All 33 regression tests PASSED
   - test_blur_detection: 11/11
   - test_common_ui: 8/8
   - test_duplicate_detection: 7/7
   - test_image_classification: 7/7

✅ Feature testing complete
   - Unicode path handling verified
   - Threshold slider tested
   - Start scan button working
   - Auto-select groups confirmed

✅ No known issues
