**[Show first launch]**

"Once installed, launch PhotoSift from your desktop or Start Menu. You'll see the main launcher with three powerful tools:

- Duplicate Image Identifier: Find and remove duplicate photos
- Blurry Image Detector: Identify poor quality photos
- Image Classifier: Sort photos by content (People vs Screenshots)

Let's take a quick tour of each tool."

**[Show each tool interface briefly]**

"The interface is clean and modern with a dark theme that's easy on the eyes. Each tool follows the same workflow: Select folder → Start scan → Review results → Clean up."

**[Demonstrate basic workflow]**

"Here's how it works: Click 'Select Folder', choose your photo directory, then click 'Start Scan'. PhotoSift uses AI to analyze your photos - this might take a few minutes for large collections."

**[Show results interface]**

"Once scanning is complete, you'll see results with confidence scores and easy-to-use checkboxes. Select the photos you want to remove, then click the red 'Clean' button to move them to trash."

**[Show trash management]**

"Don't worry about mistakes - PhotoSift includes a trash manager where you can review and restore any accidentally deleted photos."

## 🎬 Tutorial 2: PhotoSift Features Overview (3-5 minutes)

### Video Structure:
1. **Introduction (0:00-0:20)** - What PhotoSift does
2. **Tool 1: Duplicate Detection (0:20-1:30)** - Demo with examples
3. **Tool 2: Blur Detection (1:30-2:30)** - Demo with examples
4. **Tool 3: Image Classification (2:30-3:30)** - Demo with examples
5. **Common Features (3:30-4:00)** - Shared functionality
6. **Conclusion (4:00-4:30)** - When to use each tool

### Script:

**[Opening: Show diverse photo collection]**

"PhotoSift gives you three AI-powered tools to manage your photo collection. Let's see what each one does."

**[Duplicate Detection Demo]**

"First, the Duplicate Image Identifier. This tool finds visually similar photos, even if they're different sizes or have minor edits.

[Show example: Same photo at different resolutions]
PhotoSift uses advanced AI to compare image content, not just file properties. It groups duplicates and shows similarity scores.

[Show threshold slider]
You can adjust sensitivity - higher thresholds find only near-identical photos, lower thresholds catch similar images."

**[Blur Detection Demo]**

"Next, the Blurry Image Detector analyzes image sharpness using computer vision algorithms.

[Show blurry vs sharp examples]
It scores photos from Excellent (>500) to Very Blurry (<50). The adjustable threshold lets you decide what's 'too blurry' for your needs.

[Show color-coded results]
Results are color-coded for quick visual assessment - green for excellent, red for poor quality."

**[Image Classification Demo]**

"Finally, the Image Classifier automatically sorts photos into categories using OpenAI's CLIP model.

[Show People vs Screenshots examples]
It currently distinguishes between 'People photos' (portraits, group photos, selfies) and 'Screenshots' (computer screens, mobile captures).

[Show confidence scores]
Each classification includes a confidence score, and you can review uncertain results."

**[Common Features]**

"All tools share these features:
- Modern dark interface
- Batch processing for thousands of photos
- Thumbnail view with zoom controls
- Safe deletion with trash recovery
- Progress tracking and status updates"

**[Closing]**

"Use Duplicate Detection for cleaning up storage, Blur Detection for quality control, and Image Classification for content organization. Combine all three for comprehensive photo management!"

## 🎬 Tutorial 3: Finding Duplicate Photos (8-10 minutes)

### Video Structure:
1. **Introduction (0:00-0:45)** - Why duplicate detection matters
2. **Setup (0:45-2:00)** - Selecting folder and starting scan
3. **Understanding Results (2:00-4:00)** - Groups, similarity scores, thumbnails
4. **Threshold Adjustment (4:00-6:00)** - Fine-tuning duplicate sensitivity
5. **Selecting & Cleaning (6:00-7:30)** - How to remove duplicates
6. **Advanced Tips (7:30-8:30)** - Best practices and troubleshooting

### Detailed Script:

**[Opening: Show cluttered photo folder]**

"Duplicate photos can waste gigabytes of storage and make your photo library chaotic. PhotoSift's AI-powered duplicate detection finds similar images even when filenames, sizes, and formats differ."

**[Step 1: Folder Selection]**

"Start by clicking 'Select Folder' and choose your photo directory. PhotoSift will scan all common image formats.

Pro tip: For large collections, start with a smaller folder to test the results before processing your entire library."

**[Step 2: Starting the Scan]**

"Click 'Start Scan' to begin AI analysis. PhotoSift uses CLIP embeddings to understand image content - this is more accurate than simple file comparison.

The progress bar shows current file and estimated time remaining."

**[Step 3: Understanding Results]**

"Results are organized into groups of similar images. Each group shows:
- Thumbnails of all similar photos
- Similarity percentage (how alike they are)
- File paths and dates

Higher similarity scores mean the photos are more alike. 95%+ are usually identical or near-identical."

**[Step 4: Threshold Control]**

"The threshold slider controls sensitivity. Try these settings:

- 95%+: Only identical photos
- 90%+: Near-identical (minor edits)
- 85%+: Very similar
- 80%+: Similar content

Lower thresholds may catch photos that are related but not duplicates."

**[Step 5: Selection and Cleanup]**

"Check the boxes next to photos you want to delete. PhotoSift automatically selects all but one photo per group, but you can adjust selections.

The 'Clean' button moves selected photos to trash. Don't worry - you can review and restore them later."

**[Advanced Tips]**

"Best practices:
- Review groups carefully before cleaning
- Keep the highest quality version of each duplicate
- Use lower thresholds for thorough cleaning
- Process in batches for large collections

If you have many similar photos (like event photos), consider creating albums instead of deleting."

## 🎬 Tutorial 4: Blur Detection Guide (6-8 minutes)

### Key Points to Cover:
1. **What blur detection does** - Quality assessment, not just blur
2. **Threshold adjustment** - Finding the right sensitivity
3. **Quality categories** - Understanding the scoring system
4. **Practical examples** - When to use different thresholds
5. **Combining with other tools** - Workflow integration

### Script Outline:

"PhotoSift's blur detection goes beyond simple blur - it measures overall image sharpness and quality using Laplacian variance analysis."

**[Demo different threshold settings]**

"Adjust the threshold slider to control sensitivity:
- Low threshold (50-100): Catch only very blurry photos
- Medium threshold (100-250): Standard quality control
- High threshold (250+): Very strict quality standards"

**[Show real examples]**

"Here's how it works with real photos:
- Excellent (>500): Professional quality
- Good (250-500): Social media ready
- Fair (100-250): Acceptable but could be better
- Poor (50-100): Low quality
- Very Blurry (<50): Unusable"
