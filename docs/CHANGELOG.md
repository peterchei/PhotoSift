## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-14

### Fixed
- **Critical Unicode Path Bug**: Fixed issue where images in folders with Chinese characters (or other Unicode characters) were incorrectly marked as 100% duplicates
  - Root cause: OpenCV's `cv2.imread()` cannot handle Unicode paths on Windows
  - Solution: Replaced OpenCV with PIL (Pillow) for image loading in `DuplicateImageIdentifier.py`
  - Impact: All international users can now use PhotoSift with native language folder/file names
  - Details documented in `UNICODE_PATH_FIX.md`

### Enhanced
- **Similarity Threshold Control**: Added adjustable similarity threshold (80%-99%) for duplicate detection
  - User-controllable slider with real-time percentage display
  - Quality guide showing what each threshold range means (Identical/Near duplicates/Similar/Loosely related)
  - Fast re-grouping with cached embeddings (10-20x speedup)
  - Details documented in `THRESHOLD_ENHANCEMENT.md`

- **Start Scan Button**: Separated folder selection from scanning operation
  - Select folder and see image count before starting scan
  - Explicit "Start Scan" button for better control
  - Improved user workflow and scanning experience
  - Details documented in `START_SCAN_BUTTON_ENHANCEMENT.md`

- **Auto-Select Groups**: Automatically select all duplicate groups after scan/re-group
  - Immediate visual feedback after operations complete
  - No manual selection needed to view results
  - Improved user experience with instant result display
  - Details documented in `AUTO_SELECT_GROUPS_FEATURE.md`

### Improved
- **Image Loading Performance**: PIL-based loading maintains high quality while supporting Unicode
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages when images fail to load
- **Code Quality**: Simplified image loading logic, removed OpenCV dependency for image I/O

### Technical
- Replaced `cv2.imread()` with `Image.open()` for Unicode-safe file path handling
- Used LANCZOS resampling for high-quality image resizing
- Maintained backward compatibility with all existing features
- All 33 regression tests pass
