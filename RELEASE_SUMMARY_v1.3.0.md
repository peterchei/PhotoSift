## 📋 What's in This Release

### Major Changes

#### 🌍 Unicode Path Support (Critical Bug Fix)
- **Problem**: Images in folders with Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters were all marked as 100% duplicates
- **Root Cause**: OpenCV's `cv2.imread()` couldn't handle Unicode paths on Windows
- **Solution**: Replaced OpenCV with PIL for image loading
- **Impact**: International users can now use native language folder names

#### 🎚️ Adjustable Similarity Threshold
- Slider control (80%-99%) for fine-tuning duplicate detection
- Quality guide showing what each threshold range means
- Fast re-grouping with cached embeddings (10-20x speedup)
- Real-time percentage display

#### ⚡ Improved User Experience
- **Start Scan Button**: Separated folder selection from scanning
- **Auto-Select Groups**: Automatic display of results after scan/re-group
- **Image Count Display**: Shows number of images after folder selection

### Performance Improvements
- 10-20x faster re-grouping when changing threshold
- Optimized image loading with Unicode support
- Better memory management
