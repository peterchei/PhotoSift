# PhotoSift Assets

This directory contains static assets used by PhotoSift.

## üì¶ Contents

### Icons (if moved here in the future)
Currently, icons are stored in the `resources/` directory to maintain compatibility with existing build scripts:
- `resources/app.ico` - Main application icon (256x256, Windows ICO format)

The following icon files may be located here:
- `icon.ico` - Legacy icon file (if present)
- `icon.png` - PNG version of icon (if present)
- `splash_icon.png` - Splash screen icon (if present)

### Store Assets
Store-specific assets are generated during build and stored in `store_package/Assets/`:
- Square44x44Logo.png
- Square150x150Logo.png
- Square71x71Logo.png
- Square310x310Logo.png
- StoreLogo.png

These are automatically created by the `create_store_assets.py` script.

## üé® Icon Specifications

### Application Icon (resources/app.ico)
- Format: Windows ICO
- Size: 256x256 pixels (recommended)

## üîß Generating Store Assets

Store assets are automatically generated by running:
```powershell
python create_store_assets.py
```

This script:
1. Reads the source icon from `resources/app.ico`
2. Creates properly sized and formatted PNGs
3. Adds appropriate padding for visibility
4. Saves to `store_package/Assets/`

## üìù Adding New Assets

If you need to add new image assets:
1. Place source files in `resources/` (for source code access)
2. Place static/design files in `assets/` (for documentation)
3. Update build scripts if needed
