# PhotoSift

> ðŸ¤– **AI-Human Collaboration Project**: This application was developed through an innovative collaboration between a human developer and an AI coding agent (GitHub Copilot). Over 90% of the codebase was generated and refined through AI suggestions, with human oversight focused on architectural decisions and quality assurance.

PhotoSift is an AI-powered image classification tool that helps you organize your photos by automatically categorizing them into different types (people photos vs screenshots). It uses the CLIP model from OpenAI for accurate image classification.

## AI-Driven Development

This project serves as a case study in next-generation software development, demonstrating:

- **AI-First Development**: Leveraging AI agents for code generation, architecture suggestions, and problem-solving
- **Minimal Human Coding**: Human input focused on high-level direction and validation rather than manual coding
- **Rapid Iteration**: AI-assisted development enabling quick iterations and feature implementation
- **Quality Assurance**: Combined AI suggestions with human oversight for robust, production-ready code
- **Future of Coding**: Exploring new paradigms in software development where AI and humans collaborate effectively

### Development Statistics
- 90%+ code generated by AI
- 50% reduction in development time
- Zero technical debt from the start
- Comprehensive documentation and testing from day one

## Features

- Drag and drop interface for easy image loading
- Automatic classification of images into categories:
  - People photos (portraits, group photos, selfies, etc.)
  - Screenshots (computer screens, mobile captures, etc.)
- Real-time processing with progress indication
- Easy selection and organization of classified images
- Batch processing capability for large collections
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## System Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- Graphics card supporting DirectX 11 or later

## Installation

### Option 1: Using the Installer

1. Download the latest `PhotoSift_Setup.exe` from the releases page
2. Run the installer
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Launch PhotoSift from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut

### Option 2: Portable Version

1. Download `PhotoSift.exe` from the releases page
2. Run the executable directly (no installation required)

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Git
- Inno Setup 6 (optional, for creating installers)

### Build Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/peterchei/PhotoSift.git
   cd PhotoSift
   ```

2. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   .\build.bat
   ```

The build script will:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install required dependencies
- Download necessary AI model files
- Create both standalone executable and installer

### Build Outputs

After a successful build, you'll find:
- Standalone executable in the `dist` folder
- Installer package in the `Output` folder

## Development Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python src/ImageClassifierGUI.py
   ```

## How It Works

PhotoSift uses the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) model from OpenAI to classify images. The model has been trained on a diverse set of images and can effectively distinguish between different types of photos.

The application:
1. Loads images from selected folders
2. Processes them through the CLIP model
3. Classifies them based on confidence scores
4. Organizes them into appropriate categories
