# PhotoSift

> 🤖 **AI-Human Collaboration Project**: This application was developed through an innovative collaboration between a human developer and an AI coding agent (GitHub Copilot). Over 90% of the codebase was generated and refined through AI suggestions, with human oversight focused on architectural decisions and quality assurance.

PhotoSift is an AI-powered image management tool that helps you organize your photos by automatically categorizing them and identifying issues. It uses advanced computer vision techniques including the CLIP model from OpenAI for accurate image classification and OpenCV for blur detection.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   # Launch main menu to select a tool
   python src/launchPhotoSiftApp.py
   
   # Or launch individual tools directly:
   python src/ImageClassifierGUI.py           # Image classifier
   python src/DuplicateImageIdentifierGUI.py  # Duplicate finder

   ```

## How It Works

### Image Classification (People vs Screenshots)
PhotoSift uses the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) model from OpenAI to classify images. The model:
- Has been trained on millions of diverse images
- Understands the relationship between images and text descriptions
- Can effectively distinguish between different types of photos
- Provides confidence scores for each classification

**Process:**
1. Loads images from selected folders
2. Processes them through the CLIP model in batches
3. Classifies based on confidence scores
4. Organizes results into categories

### Duplicate Detection
Uses CLIP embeddings to find perceptually similar images:
- Generates high-dimensional vector representations of images
- Compares vectors using cosine similarity
- Groups images by similarity threshold
- Works even if images are resized, reformatted, or slightly edited

**Process:**
1. Generates CLIP embeddings for all images
2. Calculates similarity scores between image pairs
3. Groups similar images together
4. Presents duplicates for review and cleanup

### Blur Detection (NEW!)
Uses the Laplacian variance method to detect out-of-focus or blurry images:
- Applies the Laplacian operator to measure edge sharpness
- Calculates variance of the Laplacian (sharp edges = high variance)
- **Multi-threaded batch processing** for optimal performance
- Uses concurrent processing with up to 8 parallel workers
- Processes multiple images simultaneously for 5-8x speed improvement

**How Blur Detection Works:**
1. **Image Loading**: Reads image in grayscale for faster processing
2. **Laplacian Operator**: Calculates second derivative to detect edges
3. **Variance Calculation**: Sharp images have high variance, blurry images have low variance
4. **Threshold Comparison**: Scores below threshold are classified as blurry
5. **Quality Categorization**: Assigns quality level based on score ranges

**Blur Score Interpretation:**
- **>500**: Excellent - Very sharp with fine detail
- **250-500**: Good - Sharp with good detail
- **100-250**: Fair - Acceptable sharpness
- **50-100**: Poor - Noticeable blur
- **<50**: Very Blurry - Significantly out of focus

**Parallel Processing:**
- Utilizes CPU cores efficiently (up to 8 workers)
- Processes multiple images concurrently
- Progress updates in real-time as tasks complete
- Dramatically faster than sequential processing

### Dark Photo Detection (NEW!)
Uses HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space analysis to detect underexposed images:
- Converts images to HSV to isolate the **Value (brightness)** component
- Calculates the average pixel intensity across the entire image
- **Multi-threaded batch processing** for optimal performance
- Uses concurrent processing with up to 8 parallel workers

**How Dark Photo Detection Works:**
1. **Color Space Conversion**: Translates image data to the HSV model
2. **Brightness Analysis**: Measures the average 'Value' channel intensity (0-255)
3. **Threshold Comparison**: Images scoring below the user-defined threshold are flagged
4. **Quality Categorization**: Groups images based on their average brightness level

**Brightness Score Interpretation:**
- **<20**: Very Dark - Minimal detail visible
- **20-40**: Dark - Noticeably underexposed
- **40-60**: Dim - Slightly underexposed
- **>60**: Good/Bright - Well-exposed image

## AI-Human Collaborative Development Process

This project showcases a new paradigm in software development, where AI and humans work together seamlessly:

### Role of AI Agent
- Architecture design and suggestions
- Code generation and implementation
- Documentation creation
- Bug detection and fixes
- Test case generation
- Performance optimization recommendations

### Role of Human Developer
- Project vision and requirements definition
- Quality assurance and code review
- Final decision-making on architectural choices
- User experience validation
- Edge case consideration
- Security review

### Development Workflow
1. Human developer defines feature requirements
2. AI agent suggests implementation approaches
3. Human selects and refines the approach
4. AI generates implementation code
5. Human reviews and validates the code
6. AI assists in testing and documentation
7. Human performs final validation and deployment

This collaborative approach has resulted in:
- Faster development cycles
- Higher code quality
- Better documentation
- More comprehensive testing
- Reduced technical debt
